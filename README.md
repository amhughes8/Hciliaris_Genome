### Here, you will find a step-by-step guide to the reference genome assembly and annotation for the queen angelfish (*Holacanthus ciliaris*) using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data. The genome assembly pipeline is illustrated below, and pipelines for specific analyses (i.e. PSMC and mito genome assembly and annotation) are shared as well.
